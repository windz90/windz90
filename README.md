- 👋 Hi, I am Andy.
- 👀 I am interested in Android application/library/framework/SDK development, 2D and 3D computer vision algorithm implementation. Algorithm implementation includes numerical linear algebra, statistics, machine learning, computational geometry and convolution. Although my mathematics is not good, I am curious about the implementation of those algorithms, and curiosity is my motivation.
- 🌱 I am currently learning three-dimensional vision and image filter.
- 💞️ I am looking for people with similar interests to communicate.
- 📫 How to reach me: email me.
